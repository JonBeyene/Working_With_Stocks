# Working_With_Stocks
In this project, I will be exploring twenty different stocks and comparing them through different metrics, such as finding the risk-to-reward ratio and seeing how heavily correlated the stocks are with each other. 

The stocks I am analyzing are:
NVDA, ULTA, SHOP, WMT, BA, TOL, UHAL, BAC, AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, TSLA, AXP, IBM, OXY, SNAP, MRO, GM, UAL, DIS
